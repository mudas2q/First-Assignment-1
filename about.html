    <p>Hello! My name is Mudasir and I am a passionate learner currently studying Web Development at SMIT (Saylani Mass IT Training).</p>

<p>This portfolio website is a simple assignment project that showcases what I have learned so far. I’m exploring how websites work, how to build beautiful layouts using HTML and CSS, and how to make pages interactive with JavaScript.</p>
<p>Though I’m still learning, I enjoy writing clean code and improving every day. My goal is to become a professional full-stack developer and build real-world websites and applications that are fast, responsive, and user-friendly.</p>

<p>I created this About page to give you a glimpse into my learning journey. As I grow in skills and experience, I plan to keep improving this site and adding more projects to share my progress.</p>

<p><b>Thank you for visiting!</b></p>
